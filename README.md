Oh man, just finished watching The Monkey, and honestly, what a ride. I mean, seriously, what did I even watch? 😂 It’s like I can't decide if I'm thoroughly entertained or just confused. That monkey gets up to the wildest stuff, I swear. Tho, I gotta say, parts of it were way too predictable, you know what I mean? But then there were these random moments that just caught me off guard, and I’m like, “Wait, what?!” 

Anyway, the cinematography was kind of bonkers. And can we talk about the soundtracks? Bizarre yet low-key genius. There I was, just sitting on my couch, thinking maybe I should go download the movie myself, even though I literally just watched it. Have I lost it? Maybe. But hey, what else is new, right?

>I honestly wonder how the writers came up with some of those plot twists. Maybe it’s just a bunch of monkeys at a typewriter? HA! See what I did there? 👀 But seriously, the amount of bananas in that film… kind of impressive. Like, guys, we get it! It's about a monkey!!

Anyway, you could definitely tell it was midnight, and my brain was more like potato mush by that point. So much happened, and yet I'm not sure what actually happened, lol. It felt like they were just throwing ideas at the wall and seeing what would stick.

import thisTotallyRandomThing # Dude, why did I even think of coding right now? Brain fart, oops.

Would totally recommend for a fun watch if you have nothing else on your list, or just want something absurd and brilliantly ridiculous. And I swear, if anyone else says it's the best movie ever, I might need a moment to collect myself. But hey, give it a shot and let me know what you think!
